# Ideas

* Use a hierarchy of state machines to control not only individuals but also
groups.

* Use a ring-buffer of 3 or 4 for object position to allow the logic to execute
in a separate thread.

* Implement a small scripting language to define the state machines for units
and implement map generators.
